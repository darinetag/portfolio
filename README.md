## 🧠 About Me

I bring together design, code, and storytelling:

- 🎨 **Product & UI/UX Design** – thoughtful interfaces rooted in usability, accessibility, and clean visual systems.
- 💻 **Frontend Development** – pixel-perfect implementations with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🎬 **Video Editing & Motion** – visual storytelling that enhances user engagement.
- 🌍 **Multilingual Communication** – as a professional translator, I ensure content speaks clearly to users.

Over the past year, I've worked at an AI startup where I did the entire design pipeline: branding, UI UX, video-editing, social content, and frontend code.
